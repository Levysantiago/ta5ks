This is an app that allows you to create and manage tasks. For each task you can associate with a
project (or tag). The project represents what the task is about, for example, the task "Study to
the test tomorrow" can has the project "University" or "School". Each task has a title, a
description and a tag. This app was built to help us to controls what we need to do, what is being
done and what has been already done.
