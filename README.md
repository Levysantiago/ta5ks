## About

This is an app that allows you to create and manage tasks. It was built using 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). 
For each task you can associate with a project (or tag). The project represents what the task 
is about, for example, the task "Study to the test tomorrow" can has the project "University" 
or "School". Each task has a title, a description and a tag. This app was built to help us to 
controls what we need to do, what is being done and what has been already done.
